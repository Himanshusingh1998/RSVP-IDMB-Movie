# RSVP-IDMB-Movie

1. Created a new database called IDMB to manage movie data.

2. Designed relational tables like movie, genre, names, ratings, director_mapping, and role_mapping with appropriate datatypes and primary keys.

3. Established foreign key relationships to enforce referential integrity between related tables (e.g., movie_id in child tables referencing movie table).

4. Handled many-to-many relationships using mapping tables such as director_mapping and role_mapping.

5. Inserted sample movie data into the movie table for analysis and testing.

6. Normalized the database schema by splitting data across logical tables like names, genre, and ratings.

7. Defined clear constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY) to ensure data consistency and validity.

8. Prepared the schema for advanced queries on genres, ratings, actors, directors, and gross income.
